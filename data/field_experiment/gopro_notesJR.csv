118,NW,T6,2,16.6,4:02:08,0,2,Maaaybe a DAAR fish bite on the mesh at 3:58:47 (JR says no on second review). Yellow goby kind of dude definitely going at it starting at 4:02:08--maybe have partially just been hiding in the mesh but I think also maybe messing with the algae. 4:07:24 the blenny is back in the mesh--maybe took a couple bites on the mesh? At 4:10:87 a different little fishie I think takes some bites of the algae (JR doesn't see this on second review also not sure what 87 is) then at 4:10:49 the DAAR takes another bite (although it seems like it often just spits it out?). Devin was in the picture a lot at the end that might have messed with behavior,,,,,,
