This script is making sure there are no size differences among fragments that are potentially affecting results

# Bring in weight data

```{r}
weights <- read_csv(here("data/Coral_buoyant_weights.csv"))

metadat <- read.csv(here("data/Coral_metadata.csv")) 
```


# Look at differences between treatments

```{r}
weights %>% 
  full_join(metadat) -> weightCor


weightCor %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Treatment, y = Initial_dry_weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
m1 <- aov(Initial_dry_weight ~ Treatment, data = weightCor)
  summary(m1) # means appear to be the same
```
